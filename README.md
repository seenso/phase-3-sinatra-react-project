# Whose Turn Is It? (Backend)

Whose Turn Is It? is a communication tool to help household members coordinate the care of their pets. Care taking tasks can be assigned to household members and can be regularly scheduled for recurring tasks like feeding, walking, litter box scooping. One off tasks can also be created for tasks like vet appointments.

It has a Sinatra API backend that uses Ruby and Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a React frontend that interacts with the database via the RESTful API.
- The React frontend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/seenso/frontend-phase-3-sinatra-react-project/tree/main/frontend-phase3).

## Example API Endpoints
- Grab the current household and all (human) members, pets, and tasks.
- Add a task, associated with a household member and a pet.
- Mark tasks as complete.

## User Stories
- create a household with people and pets
- add regularly scheduled tasks (i.e. litter box, feed dog x times, in daily/weekly/etc. increments) with end dates
- create vet appts (vaccines, checkups, etc) with time, date, location
